🔄 Software Development Life Cycle & DevOps
1. The Core Phases
Phase	Description	DevOps Objective
Requirement	Defining "What" and "Why"	Aligning business goals with feasibility.
Design	Architecture & Logic	Designing for scalability and deployability.
Development	Actual coding	Small, frequent commits to shared repos.
Testing	QA & Integration	Shift Left: Automate as early as possible.
Deployment	Release to Production	Making releases boring and repeatable.
2. The Evolution of Methodology

    Waterfall (Legacy): Linear and sequential. High risk because you only see the product at the very end.

    Agile (Modern): Iterative 2-week "Sprints." Fast, but often creates a bottleneck at the release stage.

    DevOps (Standard): Removes the "Wall of Confusion" between Developers (who want change) and Operations (who want stability).

3. The Three Pillars

    Automation: Let machines do the boring, error-prone stuff.

    Small Steps: Release 1 change daily instead of 1,000 once a year.

    Feedback: Know if the app is slow in minutes, not weeks.
